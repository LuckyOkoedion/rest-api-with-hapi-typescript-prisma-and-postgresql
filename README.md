# rest-api-with-hapi-typescript-tsoa-prisma-and-postgresql

This is a church office management REST api built with Hapi js, TypeScript, Prisma ORM and Postgresql. With Unit tests and End-toEnd tests.

It is an example of how to modularize / structure hapi API implementation into controllers and services. Good separation of concerns for ease of maintenance for large projects, and type safety, courtesy of typescript.
